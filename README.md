# Hello-World
Hi there,
I'm Omid. I live and work in Australia. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher. I have a solid background in Mathematics and Computer programming. My current research involves a lot of coding and software development. I mostly use Python, C++ and quite a bit of FORTRAN. However, recently I have become extremely attracted to Data Science and I am determined to take the learning to become a Data Scientist. I am only starting now though :)
